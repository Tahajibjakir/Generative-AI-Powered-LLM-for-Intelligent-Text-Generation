# Generative-AI-Powered-LLM-for-Intelligent-Text-Generation
This notebook demonstrates how to build a natural language interface by combining Hugging Face Transformers with LangChain. Using models like Google/flan-t5-base, it sets up a conversational chain that takes dynamic prompts and returns LLM-generated outputs.
It serves as a lightweight and modular framework for quick prototyping of LLM-based applications using LangChain's prompt chaining capabilities and Hugging Faceâ€™s powerful model zoo.

## Features

â€¢ Access to pre-trained LLMs (e.g., FLAN-T5) from Hugging Face via API
â€¢ LangChain integration to create prompt templates and chains
â€¢ Easy prompt injection using PromptTemplate and LLMChain
â€¢ Fully configurable with any supported Hugging Face model
â€¢ No local model hosting required â€” models are fetched via Hugging Face Hub
â€¢ Clean, minimal, and reusable LangChain + HuggingFaceHub template
â€¢ Suitable for question-answering, summarization, instruction-following, and more


## Model Details 
â€¢ Backend: Hugging Face Hub (HuggingFaceHub integration via API key)

â€¢ Model Example: google/flan-t5-base

----Instruction-tuned T5 model

----Lightweight and fast for zero-shot tasks

â€¢ Inference Style: Prompt â†’ LangChain â†’ Hugging Face Model â†’ Response

Contributor can easily switch to other models like:

â€¢ tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct

â€¢ mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1

â€¢ meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf
